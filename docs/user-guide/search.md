```
"How do I restart the Apache web server?"
"What's the procedure for database backup?"
"Show me all firewall configuration documents"
"How do we handle a security incident?"
"What are the steps for user account provisioning?"
```

**Infrastructure Questions**
```
"How to configure SSL certificates on nginx?"
"What's our disaster recovery plan?"
"Show me network topology documentation"
"How do we monitor server performance?"
"What are the requirements for new server setup?"
```

**Policy and Compliance Questions**
```
"What's our password policy?"
"Show me GDPR compliance procedures"
"What are the security audit requirements?"
"How do we handle data breach notifications?"
