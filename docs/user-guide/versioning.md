## Version Control Overview

### Why Document Versioning Matters
In IT environments, documentation changes frequently due to:
- **System Updates**: Infrastructure and software changes
- **Process Improvements**: Refined procedures and workflows
- **Compliance Requirements**: Regulatory and policy updates
- **Security Changes**: Updated security procedures and policies
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple contributors improving documentation

### Surge's Versioning Approach

- Every significant change creates a new version automatically
- No manual intervention required for basic version tracking
- Configurable save intervals and change thresholds
- Real-time collaboration integrated with versioning

**Comprehensive Change Tracking**
- **What Changed**: Detailed diff showing exact modifications
- **Who Changed It**: Author attribution for every change
- **When It Changed**: Precise timestamps for all modifications
- **Why It Changed**: Optional change summaries and comments

## Understanding Document Versions

### Version Numbering System

#### Automatic Version Numbers
Surge uses a sequential version numbering system:
- **Version 1**: Initial document creation
- **Version 2**: First significant modification
- **Version 3**: Next modification, and so on...

**Version Triggers**
- **Content Changes**: Substantial text modifications
- **Structure Changes**: Adding/removing sections, reorganization
- **Metadata Updates**: Title, description, or tag changes
- **Auto-save Points**: Periodic automatic version creation
- **Manual Save**: Explicit version creation by users

#### Version Metadata
Each version includes comprehensive metadata:
```yaml
version_info:
  version_number: 15
  created_at: "2024-01-15T14:30:22Z"
  author: "john.smith@company.com"
  workspace: "IT Operations"
  content_hash: "sha256:7d865e959b2466918c9863afca942d0fb89d7c9ac0c99bafc3749504ded97730"
  changes_summary: "Updated incident escalation procedures"
  parent_version: 14
  word_count: 2847
  character_count: 18392
  sections_modified: ["escalation-procedures", "contact-information"]
```

### Version States and Lifecycle
