## Understanding Workspaces

### What are Workspaces?
Workspaces are collaborative environments that organize related documentation and team members. Think of them as dedicated areas for specific teams, projects, or domains within your IT organization.

### Key Benefits
- **Organized Collaboration**: Keep related documents and discussions together
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for different team members
- **Team Productivity**: Track engagement and contribution across team members
- **Knowledge Silos Prevention**: Break down barriers between teams while maintaining security
- **Scalable Structure**: Support both small teams and large enterprise departments

### Common IT Workspace Examples
- **Network Operations**: Network documentation, monitoring procedures, incident responses
- **Security Team**: Security policies, vulnerability assessments, compliance documentation  
- **Development Team**: API documentation, deployment procedures, architecture guides
- **Help Desk**: User guides, troubleshooting procedures, FAQ documentation
- **Project-Specific**: Dedicated spaces for major IT initiatives or implementations
